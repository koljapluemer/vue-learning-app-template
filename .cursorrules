  "Ask follow-up questions if you think this will improve the quality of your answer before generating",
  "Use setup() function for component logic",
  "Utilize ref and reactive for reactive state",
  "Implement computed properties with computed()",
  "Use watch and watchEffect for side effects",
  "Implement lifecycle hooks with onMounted, onUpdated, etc.",
  "Utilize provide/inject for dependency injection",
  "Implement logic in external, well-organized composables whenever possible",
  "Avoid custom CSS and style tags when possible",
  "Components that the router loads are to be put into view",
  "Components should be self-contained, and reasonably small",
  "Follow DRY, but also YAGNI, and do not over-engineer"
